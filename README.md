## MLDL
The library uses at its core the [TensorLib](https://github.com/Progxy/TensorLib) library to perform Tensor-based operations.
It currently offers the possibility to parse small datasets, as well as it offers a set of functions to simply manipulate and define the model.
Furthermore, it offers a simple AutoGrad based on Reverse AutoDifferentiation.
It implements some common Activation Functions, as well as Optimization Functions like Adam and SDG.

To compile simply use `make`.

#### Note
The autograd at the moment has probably some bugs, as well as the project is still unfinished.
